            "body": "Anonymous sources from within BioCyte Systems report that the research vessel Hekate has ceased communication with the company's control center on Luna, and is presumed lost. BioCyte, who have courted controversy in the past with their unilateral media blackouts regarding their research projects, have declined to comment. We here at SNN can only hope that this is a minor equipment malfunciton, and that the Hekate and her crew will return safe and sound, whatever thier mission may be."
