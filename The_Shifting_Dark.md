**The Shifting Dark** is a single-shot adventure module for **Mothership**, a science fiction horror RPG by Tuesday Knight Games.

Below are two different backgrounds to give The Warden a feel for what will be happening in this adventure. The first background sets up the story to contain themes of **body horror**, **transformation**, and **unethical human experimentation**. Make sure to have a discussion with the players about their boundaries, and what they are comfortable with. If anybody expresses concerns about these themes, feel free to use the _2.2: Alternate Background_ as your guideline for what's happening behind the scenes, or make up your own. Remember, this is a horror adventure, but it should not be horrible to play. Be considerate, be safe, and enjoy **The Shifting Dark**


# _Section 1: Exposition_
*From System News Network; Dated March 18th 2102*
> Anonymous sources from within BioCyte Systems report that the research vessel Hekate has ceased communication with the company's control center on Luna, and is presumed lost. BioCyte, who have courted controversy in the past with their unilateral media blackouts regarding their research projects, have declined to comment. We here at SNN can only hope that this is a minor equipment malfunciton, and that the Hekate and her crew will return safe and sound, whatever thier mission may be.

# _Section 2: Warden Information_

## _2.1: Background_
> The Hekate is an experiment. BioCyte systems had been developing a bio-weapon which could be used as a siege breaker, even though these kinds of weapons and their use was explicitly outlawed by the System Oversight Committee after the Phobos Colony Massacre. The artificial virus is supposed to re-animate and contiunally evolve dead organic material, turning enemy casualties into weapons. They needed a testing ground, and though the people at BioCyte are certainly monsters, they are not stupid enough to test such a weapon on Earth, or even on Luna. And so, named for the Godess of magic, witchcraft, and necromancy (amont other things), the Hekate bore forth with an unsuspecting crew. The ships computer was programmed to drop the ship into a low power cycle after everyone had been infected, and to return to our system in approximately 5 years time, after it was assumed that all organic matter on the ship would have been consumed or died out, and the ships security feeds and flight logs could be studied. But what would happen if the things on board were still alive? Simple, hire a crew from an outside salvage company through a shell corporation, send them to get the black box back. If that crew doesn't return, simply nuke their craft, along with the Hekate out of existance, and deny everything. What could go wrong?

> Nobody at BioCyte anticipated that once a creature had been assimilated, it would retain its knowledge and sentience. The saving grace of this is that virtually everything function on the Hekate is gated behind a bio-lock, which only certain crew members can activate. The creatures, once they had changed, were no longer able to activate many of the ships systems, even if they wanted to. Driven completely insane by rage, confusion, and the horror or inhabiting their new, ever evolving forms, the creatures are barely concious anymore. They stalk the ship, lashing out at its structures or at eachother, locked in a perpetual arms race against one anothers constantly shifting forms. 

## _2.2: Alternate Background_
Use this background if the players are uncomfortable dealing with the themes of the adventure. This alternate background is meant to serve as a stand in so that the warden may "re-skin" the adventure, while still using the same monsters and ship layouts. If this is the case, rename "Griggs" to "The Matriarch", and use the alternate _Secrets & Clues_ and _Significan Ship Log Entries_ lists in Section 3.

> The Hekate originally set out to test a new kind of ration pack which would help to mitigate the wear and tear that long term zero-g exposure puts on the human body. The mission was simple, travel to the end of the solar system and back, and observe any changes which occured in crew physiology. That mission changed drastically, however, when the ship picked up a signal being emmited from an unidentified craft. Upon boarding the craft, the crew of the Hekate were shocked to find inhuman creatures, all of them frozen from an apparent hull breach on their ship. Under orders from BioCyte corporate, the creatures were brought back on to the ship for study and experimentation, as it was determined that surely nothing organic could survive exposure to the the vacuum. Surely, nothing could. 

> By the time the crew realized that the creatures were not in fact dead, there was nothing to be done. In a final act of heroic defiance, the crew sent an emergency communicae to the BioCyte control center on Luna explaining the situatin, and set the ship on an automated course far outside our solar system. What they did not know, however, was that BioCyte transmitted one final command to the Hekate's central computer system. To come back. It now falls to the unsuspecting crew aboard a salvage ship to face the horror which lurks within the Hekate.

## _2.3: The Hekate_
### _Upon encountering the ship for the first time:_
> The Hekate tumbles lazily end over end in an infinite spiral. The sleek, black vessel would be virtually invisible against the blackness of space if not for the running lights, which pulse a pale blue every 30 seconds. The lights inside the craft are off, and your ship's lights glance off of the viewports set into the sides of the hull. You can see that at least one part of the ship has suffered explosive decompression, and as the blown out room tumbles into your view, the inside is illuminated. Everyting is blackened, as if there has been a fire or an explosion, and you can _just_ barely see that the door to this room was welded shut from the inside. The main airlock seems to be in tact, however, and the mechanical overrides appear undamaged by asteroids or other debris. 

**Notes:** 
- The players may, at this point attempt to scan or probe the ship in some fashion. In this case, refer to one of the secrets and clues entries in _Section 3: Tables & Lists_

### _Upon entering the Hekate's main airlock for the first time:_
> As you step into the airlock, you are immediately greeted with the bodies of four androids. They sit two against the left and right walls, legs straight out with their hands folded neatly in their laps. They each appear to have suffered severe surface damage, with one missing an arm, and another looking partially melted. One of them appears to have had it's midsection crushed, and another one has been hewn across the chest from shoulder to hip. One of them has a credit-card shaped steel case with an electronic lock on a lanyard around it's neck. 

**Notes:** 
- The steel case contains several thin, stamped metal cards. On the cards are printed override codes for the bio-locks on the ship. The cards themselves can withstand extreme temperatures, so the case can be cut open with a hand welder if need be. The cards for Command, Security, Comms, and the Medbay are missing.

### _Upon entering the Hekate past the airlock for the first time:_
> The once pristine surfaces of the Hekate's interior are covered in a patina of dust. As you step out of the airlock and motion is detected, the emergency lights which are not blown out kick on, bathing every surface in a deep crimson, barely enough to see by. A low creaking moan can be heard as the ship spins head over heel, the metal of the hull expanding and contracting as the heat of the sun bathes its surface in parts as it tumbles through the void. The wall directly in front of you has a splash of blood, black under the emergency lights. Blood and...something else. Suddenly, another creak gurgles up from the depths of the ship. But sharper this time; more purposeful and more...organic. 

**Notes:**
- Sanity Save or 1 stress upon hearing the second cry. 

- Intelligence Check to determine that the other material on the wall is at least 1d% human DNA. 

### _Upon entering the Living Quarters for the first time:_
> Seven sets of triple stacked bunks are drilled into the walls of this chamber. Four against one wall, and three against the other. Clearly, this was a room intended for sleeping in shifts. The room is in disarray, but no more than the normal amount to be expected in the living quarters of a spacecraft. There is a picture on the wall of the crew of the Hekate, all of them smiling. The glass over the photo is broken inwards, and one of the crew members has their face scratched out. They are listed on the back of the photo as "Griggs - Data Specialist".

**Notes:** 
- If the players inspect the room closely, one can see that there is a vent underneath one of the bunks that has had its cover torn off of the wall. The space around the vent is slick with some kind of biological material. 

- The vent leads to Engineering.

- Griggs' bunk, one of those on the ground level, is oddly clean. 

### _Upon entering the Medbay for the first time:_
> An adroid lies crumpled in the corner of the medbay. It appears to have "died" protecting something, wrapped tightly against what remains of it's chest. The terminal screens in the medbay are burnt out, and one look can tell you that nothing short of a complete replacement will fix them.

**Notes:**
- The "something" in the android's grasp is a mag-locked physical printout of the ships medical logs. 

- The logs can be accessed via hacking, physical jailbreaking, or a hand welder. If a hand welder is used, there is a 60% chance that the logs within are illegible. Otherwise, the basic medical observations of Biochemical Compount SRN772846 are present. (Explain the basic expected behavior of the virus to the players)

- The Medbay contains the **Command Keycard**.

### _Upon entering the Science Lab / Computer Banks for the first time:_
> The central rotunda of the Hekate lies in ruin. Screens are smashed, cabinets have been torn open with incredible force, parts of the floor seem to be melted away, and bullet holes pepper the inside of the chamber. The floor is criss-crossed with bloody footprints, only some of which appear to be human. Against one wall, there is a large, organic looking pustule. From time to time, it expands and contracts like a lung, sending out a cloud of dark spores. Pinned to the center of the main viewscreen of the chamber with a combination of metal and organics is one of the Androids. It slowly turns its head to the players, and announces in an extremely artifacted voice "Yyouuu d o nottt hahahavvve auttttthorizedd acCesS t0 Thhhhis secTion of t he vEsseLl. PleAse reporporporport to seCcurityy oficceererer GrAAAAAnt".

**Notes:**

- The android will continue to repeat that the players are not authorised to be here, unless presented with either the physical override codes, the black box unlock code, or being hacked by making a Intelligence [+] Check (The advantage is to represent the severe damage to its internal systems).

- After answering a few of the player's questions, the android will turn and note that "some of them are coming back", which will kick off a round of combat. 

- The android will always mention the location of the black box (Command) before the combat event is triggered. 

- The pustule, upon closer inspection, has four limbs extending from it. A Intellect Check, or scan with a medscanner reveal that this too, was once human. 

### _Upon entering the Engineering for the first time:_
> The main reactor of the Hekate moves through its low power cycle quietly, its turbines slowly turning just enough to provide the ship with the most minimal of power. It is immediately obvious that somebody has sabatoged, or attempted to sabatoge the engines. The oxygen scrubbers are located in this room as well, and though they don't appear to have any surface damage, you notice that they are not recieving power. 

**Notes:**

- A Spitter and a Roper hide on the ceiling in the chamber. If the players look up or attempt to scan the room, they will be spotted, and combat will start. If the players do not do this, and instead interact with either the reactor or the oxygen scrubbers, the monsters will drop in and potentially get a surprise round on the players. 

- The fact that the oxygen scrubbers are not recieving power is a major red flag. The players would know that this is standard procedure on any spacecrafft, and the fact that they are not receiving any power would be by design. 

- If the players restart the reactor, alarm claxons sound, and it becomes clear after an Intellect check that the reactor will destabalize in 2d10+10 hours when running at full power. 

- Engineering contains the **Comms Keycard**.

### _Upon entering Comms for the first time:_
> The comms station is the only chamber in the ship which is not bio-locked. It is also mislabeled on the door as "RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL DUMP. AUTHORIZED PERSONEL ONLY". Entering the Comms station, you find it oddly pristine. The door is fully functional even on low power, and will provide a relatively safe place to rest if the players wish it, although an uncomfortable one. The computer stations in the comms center are still functional, and if powered, the screens blink aliveL asking for the password.

**Notes:**
- The password is the same as the door override code.

- Three incorrect password entries will sound alarm claxons, drawing enemies (roll on _3.4: Encounter Table_)

- The comms station contains communication logs between the androids onboard the Hekate and BioCyte corporate. Use these logs to answer 3 questions from the players. 

- The comms station contains the **Medbay Keycard**. 

### _Upon entering Security for the first time:_
> The first thing that catches your eyes is just how "homey" the security office is on the Hekate. There are posters and photos on the wall. A wooden bird which once bobbed up and down out of a now dry glass of water sits idle on the desk. The security camera screens are dark, but appear to be intact. There is a standard battle dress suit lying face down, toward a gun locker on the wall. It's backplate is melted inward. Rolling the body over reveals a name patch: "S.O. GRANT"

**Notes:**
- The gun locker is locked by an alphanumeric lock.

- There are several band posters on the wall, all from old terran concerts. There are several for the band "King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard"

- The combination is "KGLW"

- Three (3) unsucessful attempts at unlocking the locker will sound alarm claxons, triggering a **Dangerous** encounter on the encounter table. 

- The lock has an anti-theft device inside it, a small shrapnel charge which detonates if it gets above a certain temperature (like if someone cuts into it with a hand welder). The shrapnel does 6d10 damage, -20% vs. Armor Save.

- The locker contains an unloaded revolver (2 reloads), a Combat Shotgun (1d6 reloads), and 1d4 Grenades

### _Upon entering Command for the first time:_
> The Command chamber has a large view-port in front of the captains chair. All of the computer screens are smashed. It takes you a moment to notice, but there is a figure sitting in the command chair. Noticing your presence, it turns and stands. Impossibly tall, its head almost touching the ceilng, the creature looks into your eyes, the amber lamps set deep into it's gaunt face piercing your very soul (if you believe in that sort of thing). It stands there for a moment, sizing you up, before it opens its far-too-large mouth and speaks in a raspy voice. 

**Notes:**
- If the players have not encountered Griggs yet, this is it. 

- Griggs will speak, but not go too deep into exposition. She is not interested in anwering questions. If the players do not immediately retreat, she will attack. 

### _Upon entering the Galley for the first time:_
> The galley door is shot full of holes, and after prying it open, one can see that this was the place of a last stand. The tables and chairs are turned towards the door as makeshift cover. There is a still human corpse in here, savaged as if it fought until the last breath, until what must have been a grenade went off. Around what's left of it's neck is another steel case, much like that found around the android's neck in the main airlock. The revolver in it's hand is nearly spend. One shot left, clearly not used for it's intended recipient.

**Notes:**
- The case around the corpses neck contains another crew photo, this one not defaced. It also contains a hastily scribbled note; the only legible part of which reads "god damn them all, I was told". The rest is cut off. 

### _Upon entering the Cryo Chamber for the first time:_
> The door to the Cryo Chamber has been welded shut from the inside. Upon breaking through, you see that there is a single survivor in the Cryo Chamber. A young crew member, who looks no more than 25. their curly black hair falls down over their shoulders, and touches the revolver across their chest, the hammer thumbed back and ready to fire. 

**Notes:**
- Upon unfreezing (which will take 1d10 hours and a Medical Check), she will panic, and attack a random player. If she can be subdued, she will answer any questions the players have to the best of her ability. She will beg to be taken off of the ship, and insist that the players destroy the Hekate as soon as possible, black box be damned. **She is infected**

- The crew member has the **Security Keycard** in her possession. 

## _2.4: Win / Fail Conditions:_
The players can "win" the scenario by:
- Retrieving the black box on board the Hekate and returning to their ship.

- Destroying the Hekate (most likely by overloading it's core).

- Exterminating all creatures left alive aboard the vessel.

## _2.4.1: Win Script:_
> As you pull away from the Hekate, you see its frame fade into obscurity. Whatever horror existed on board, you have left it behind. You stumble back to the Cryo-Chamber on your ship, falling blissfully into the blackest sleep that any human being can know. You will have to recount this experience to somebody someday, and all you can hope is that they will believe you.

The players "lose" the scenario by:
- Being killed off.

- Escaping without the black box (they will be fugitives).

- Becoming infected on board the Hekate.
# _Section 3: Tables & Lists_
### _3.1.1: Secrets and Clues_
- Hekate is the Greek Godess of magic, witchcraft, night, the moon, ghosts, and necromancy.

- If consulted, the ships manifest will reveal that of the 21 crew members, 6 were androids.

- A successful scan of the ships atmosphere will reveal that there are trace amounts of an unidentified organic material in the air, and a total lack of oxygen.

- A Bio scan of the ship will reveal that there are in fact several hotspots, as well as several roaming bio signatures.

- The ship's core is unstable, and will detonate in 2d10+10 hours if brought back up to full power. 

- The ship's core was clearly sabatoged by one of the ships crew, though it seems that they did not finish the job. There is no body. 

- Upon entering the airlock, four of the androids are sitting against the wall. none are functional, but their memory cores can be extracted and reviewed on the players ship. 

- The androids memory cores are heavily hevaily encrypted, and will take a Intelligence [-] Check to decode, or 2d10 hours by using the ships processing power. 

- The cover story for the astronauts on board was that they were to test a new ration type, which would help mitigate the wear and tear space travel puts on the body. 

- The creatures as they are now are not entirely mindless, but certainly are insane. Any attempt at communication will only be successful with Griggs, who can be found in the command module of the ship.

- The Virus is not deadly, but will turn dead characters in a matter of hours. Players can choose to come to The Warden's side of the screen and play against the rest of the party if they wish. 

- Griggs's bunk in the living quarters contain a picture of her with the rest of the crew. Presenting this image to Griggs will effectively stun her for one round as her mind reels. 

### _3.1.2: Alternate Secrets & Clues_
- Hekate is the Greek Godess of magic, witchcraft, night, the moon, ghosts, and necromancy.

- If consulted, the ships manifest will reveal that of the 21 crew members, 6 were androids.

- A successful scan of the ships atmosphere will reveal that there are trace amounts of an unidentified organic material in the air, and a total lack of oxygen.

- A Bio scan of the ship will reveal that there are in fact several hotspots, as well as several roaming bio signatures.

- The ship's core is unstable, and will detonate in 2d10+10 hours if brought back up to full power. 

- The ship's core was clearly sabatoged by one of the ships crew, though it seems that they did not finish the job. There is no body. 

- Upon entering the airlock, four of the androids are sitting against the wall. none are functional, but their memory cores can be extracted and reviewed on the players ship. 

- The androids memory cores are heavily hevaily encrypted, and will take a Intelligence [-] Check to decode, or 2d10 hours by using the ships processing power. 

- The xenos aboard the ship have displayed a propensity for mimicry, which gives them their human-like appearance.

- The xenos aboard the ship **are** intelligent, and can be seen engaging in basic tool use. Their natural tools and weapons are their preferred choice, however.

- Only The Matriarch has the ability to mimic human speech and though patters. It will attempt to speak in a halting, raspy voice if provoked. 

- The xenos are from another far away galaxy, how exactly they came to the Sol system is secondary. They have re-animated and sustained themselves on the bio-mass of the Hekate's crew, but their next immediate goal is the acuisition of more. Preferably, earth. 

- The xenos exist to assimilate and destroy. Though The Matriarch can speak, she will not be swayed from her mission to bring her and her brood to Earth. 

### _3.2: Rumours about BioCyte_
Whether or not these rumours are true is up to either the players, or The Warden. 

1d10 | I heard that they...

### _3.3.1: Significant Ships Log Entries_
> _January 21, 2102:_ So far, so good. We've cleared the last colony and are ready to start our experiment in ernest. Apparently, these new rations are supposed to help offset the toll that months in space can take on the body, so all we're to do is to observe eachother for the duration. We're only going to the edge of the system and back, so we shouldn't be out for more than a couple of months. There will be a control group of course, 6 of us won't be participating so we can administer medical aid if something goes wrong. All things considered, this is a total milk run. I can't believe I got this assignment as my first Sr. Research Lead mission. And best of all, none of those androids to worry about! I know, I know, the three laws and all. But still theres something about them that gives me the creeps. 

> _February 1st, 2102_: Griggs died yesterday. Just fell down dead into her cereal. It's odd, you know, you get so used to the dangers that space travel represents, I mean we all sign up for it, but your body can still betray you. Hell, Griggs's always the one to remind us of it. Or was I guess I should say. I'll miss her gallows humour. Just the other day she had us all howling around the dinner table, talking about "this must be the nicest maze that any of us fuckin' lab rats have ever been in!". We're doing an autopsy tomorrow, but suffice to say everyone is a little less excited for mealtime. 

> _February 2nd, 2102:_ There must have been something about Griggs's physiology that didn't play nice with what was in the new rations. I understand that this is why we do test, but I thought that this was ironed out in the testing phase? How does a company as big as BioCyte fuck that up? Isn't that what animal testing and the penal colonies are for? And since when does the science officer outrank the Sr. Research Lead? I should be the one doing the autopsy. Hell, I should be the one in the fucking control group.

> _February 8th, 2102:_ Two more deaths. Something is very wrong here. In fact, I would go so far as to say something is fucked. I am hereby ordering an official inquiry into Ration Experiment 004 onboard the RS Hekate. Why are these rations so wildly incompatible with some of our crews bodies? Why is the control group doing all of the autopsies? and why the FUCK won't they let us see any of the bodies? I know their still in there, a blatant violation of hazardous material disposal protocols. 

> _February 9th, 2102:_ Fuck. I just saw Griggs. I was jogging around the center chamber to blow off steam and I saw her, I fucking saw her. She was staring at me through one of the doors. Then she stood up and she was too tall. I mean Griggs was 5'4'' on a good day, bt the thing I saw through the window was 8 feet all easily. What in the fuck is going on here? I must be hallucinating. Fuck this, even BioCyte doesn't pay enough to eat whatever the fuck's in these rations. I can't even find the fucking control group members to check me out. Half of us are sick in bed, half of us are driving ourselves up the wall with paranoia. 

> _February 10, 2102:_ help

### _3.3.2: Alternate Ships Log Entries_
> _January 21, 2102:_ So far, so good. We've cleared the last colony and are ready to start our experiment in ernest.

I can't believe I got this assignment as my first Sr. Research Lead mission. This should be some smooth sailing. The rations don't even taste that bad!

> _February 1st, 2102:_ I, um, I don't know exactly what to say so I'll just say it. We found something, drifting out here. At first I thought it was a sensor malfunction but once we brought it up on the viewscreen there was no denying it. It's a ship. At least that's what we think now. It certainly isnt naturally occuring, and the material is unknown. If it is a ship, then theres been some sort of hull breach, we can see that one side of it is blown open. We've recieved orders that we're to board the craft and see what we can find. Part of me is terrified but...also exhilirated. I wonder what could be aboard?

> _February 1st, 2102 - Supplemental:_ Well, it's certainly a craft, and it certainly wasn't made by humans. The...things we found don't even come close to resembling us. They're more like...I don't know how to describe them. There was talk about destroying the craft but once Corporate got wind of that idea they went ballistic. We're to bring the creatures aboard for study. If we've scanned them once we've scanned them one hundred times, all of the organic matter on board that craft is entirely inert. I don't know. We don't even know what their ship is made of, what if they're not really dead? Orders are orders I suppose, but when I look at those things, all those zeroes on the end of our paychecks dont seem to add up to much. 

> _February 8th, 2102:_ We checked. I swear, we scanned each of those things one hundred times. They were inert, I swear to god. But one of our medical androids was analyzing the tissue and it..it..I don't know what it did but now the android is lying in a corner, and that..thing is just standing over him. I think it's changing, it looks more human like now, but still wrong. Security Officer Grant has siezed control of the mission and contained that area of the ship, and I'm happy to oblige. We need to turn this ship around now. We need help.

> _February 9th, 2102:_ We woke up two days ago to alarm claxons sounding. Grant, Thrumon, Peters and Adeline are dead. Containment breached. It's been chaos ever since. We've welded ourselves into one of the cargo holds but we can hear these things at the door. Griggs managed to access the ships computers through one of the terminals in here and we've re-routed the Hekate. I don't know what direction we're headed but we shouldn't be coming back to the Sol system. The ships piloting computers were never intended to be brute forced like this but I think we've got it. But if we made a mistake, if we messed up somehow, I've put this message on a broadcast loop. [pounding aginst a door can be heard in the background] If you're picking this up, this is the final transmission of BioCyte Systems Sr. Research Lead Daniel Bretton. Steer clear of this ship. Destroy it on sight. Do not, under any circumstances, board the Hekate. I repeat, do not board the Hekate.

> _February 10th, 2102:_ EMERGENCY OVERRIDE RECIEVED. AUTHORIZATION [REDACTED]. ERROR DETECTED. AUTOPILOT INSTRUCTION BUFFER FULL. ATTEMPTING BUFFER DUMP. BUFFER DUMP FAILED. NEW ORDER IN QUEUE. HEKATE WILL RETURN TO THE SOL SYSTEM IN APROX. 5 YEARS TIME.
